# Mixxy

## Table of Contents

We list the things we talk about

## Introduction

We very quickly summarize what we're doing

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to summarize a thing

### Scope

Discuss things we want to do, and things we *don't* want to do

### Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations

Anything not obvious

### References

That IEEE document, I guess?

### Overview

Is this part even really necessary?  Introductions are supposed to be quick summaries; should I really have to read a list of definitions before I understand an introduction?

## Overall description

### Product perspective

With the advent of social media, much of digital culture now revolves around freely sharing--and occasionally modifying--user-made content.  Mixxy is designed with this trend in mind, to empower artists and illustrators of all skills to put their own twist on an existing work.  How this is applied is left entirely to the user base -- community-built stories, collaborative works, and even outright parody come to mind, though by no means should they be seen as limits.

### Product functions

More formally, Mixxy is an art platform where users can not only post and share their own work, but freely remix that of others.  Users may provide or remix content with either the provided in-browser image editor or through their own preferred toolset, uploading their work to Mixxy upon its completion.  Users can discuss works with one another, follow creators they admire, or find works based on a particular subject matter.

### User characteristics

Mixxy is designed primarily for the benefit of artists and their enthusiasts, with particular attention to the comic fanbase.  We expect that most potential users are young (typically ages 15-30) and reasonably tech-savvy.

Children under the age of 13 may not use Mixxy, due to legal requirements that we cannot meet pertaining to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

### Constraints

The following issues arose in the design of Mixxy, all of which affect our options as developers:

### Assumptions and dependencies

Any invalidation of these assumptions can affect the requirements.

## Specific requirements

### External interfaces

How will the user interact?

### Functions

Now we discuss things we actually have to do.  UI mockups will probably be dotted around here

#### Thing
  - List of things
  - Let's keep it concise

#### Other thing
  - This is text
  - I like words

### Performance requirements

Should we expect the user to go make a cup of coffee while waiting for something to happen?  (Hint: no)

### Logical database requirements

@bsabz this is your time to shine (ER diagrams will probably go here, too)

### Design constraints

What restrictions (not conscious choices; I.e. don't say "we use Bootstrap") must we consider when designing this app?

### Software system attributes

What ultimately describes what Mixxy should be?  Yes, the usualy gamut of "reliable", "secure", etc. but remember, this is for people.  "Fun", "social", etc. are just as important

### Additional comments

I write more things
